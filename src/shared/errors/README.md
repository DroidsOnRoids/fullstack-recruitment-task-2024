### Shared

The shared folder serves as a centralized repository for various shared resources, including domain errors etc. While the filename suggestions provided are indicative, the actual content and structure within this folder are designed to facilitate seamless communication and collaboration between different domains within the system architecture.

# Domain Errors

This directory contains standardized error definitions and codes specific to different domains within the system. It helps ensure consistency and clarity in error handling and reporting across the application.

### Example Workflow:

- Domain Error Occurs:

  - An error specific to a particular domain occurs during the execution of domain-specific functionalities.

- Domain Error Handling:

  - The domain-specific error is caught and handled within the respective domain's codebase using domain error definitions.

- Mapping to HTTP Layer:

  - The domain error is mapped to an appropriate HTTP status code and error response format at the HTTP layer.

- Inclusion in API Responses:
  - The transformed HTTP error response, including the mapped domain error, is returned as part of the API response to the client.
